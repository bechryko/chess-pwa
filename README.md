# Chess-PWA

A progressive web application that allows the user to play chess with a friend locally or against an AI. Supports authentication and online leaderboards, so after registering the user can compete with others from the web.
The application's source code is exceptional due to the contribution of highly experienced Angular developers.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Run as PWA

Run `npm run server` to build the project and open it with a http-server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. You can now install the application and use it in offline mode.
